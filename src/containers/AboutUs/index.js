    <div>“To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding something interesting an ordinary place… I’ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.” With these thoughts of Elliott Erwitt, I want to share the way I like to see the extraordinary in the ordinary through my pictures.

    Terra is my photography website to display the subtilities found in the awe-inspiring Earth. Terra focusses on portraying earth in a way that shows that each and every corner of our planet is beautiful and you can experience it from everyday mundane places like your roof and there is no need to limit yourself to traveling to experience Earth’s beauty. 
    Terra will be developed gradually as the training program proceeds. It will adhere to the fundamentals learnt from the course. Using React.js and Redux knowledge, Terra will be built as per the best practises used in the industry.
